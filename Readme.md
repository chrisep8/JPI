How to use
==========

This is a very old code, one of the first website i build, very imperfect. The is one version below the final version that is shown on the website, it's missing only the asset and images, the react and sass file should be copmlete.

1. `npm install`, to install all dependencies listed in package.json

2. `npm install -g browserify watchify`, to install tools needed to build the application

3. Install [ruby](http://rubyinstaller.org/) than [sass](http://sass-lang.com/install), [compass](http://compass-style.org/install/) and [susy](http://susydocs.oddbird.net/en/latest/install/) 

4. `compass compile`, to compile the stylesheet

5. `watchify jsx/app.jsx -o js/app.js -t [babelify --presets react,es2015] -v`, to build the application and rebuild it every time changes happens on jsx files,
        explanation: 
                watchify    = watch mode for browserify, used for bundling multiple js files into one using ES6 import or NodeJS requires
                -o          = output-file, in this case js/app.js
                -t          = extension for browserify to make it do something else
                babelify    = the extension used, it's job is to convert different js languages into the currently common js standard, ES5
                --presets   = the language setting used, here it is react(which uses jsx) and es2015(another name used for the ES6 standard)
